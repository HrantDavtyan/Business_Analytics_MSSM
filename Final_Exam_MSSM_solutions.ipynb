        "Baker Street VC is an Armenia-based vencture capital firm that invests in local and Sillicon Valley based startups. The firm believes the key to success for any buisness is Analytics. As thus, they hire a graduate from MSSM program at AUA named Jack, to assist them with analytics in all spheres of their business. Jack has access to the startus dataset that Baker Street VC has collected over the years. The dataset holds a lot of characteristics of startups and ther founders. Additionally, description on the features (variables) in the dataset is also available. Both files are available on Moodle or [here](https://github.com/HrantDavtyan/Training_materials/blob/master/Final.zip).\n",

        "\n",
        "As Baker Street VC considers people being the greatest asset of the company, they believe that the success of a startup considerebly depends on its founders' (and co-founders') soft and hard skills. Therefore, apart from demographic data, they have also collected information on different skill tests. As there are too many different founders, Jack has suggested to cluster them into several groups for better decision-making.\n",

        "***Your task: cluster founders based on their results of the skill tests.***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solution steps in bullet points:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Find in the dataset and separate all the data related to founder's skill tests (e.g. eningeering, busines sstragety, data science scores etc.)\n",
        "- Do **NOT** include the overall skills score, to avoid multicollinearity (overall skill score is calculated based on separate skill scores, thus they convey the same  information)\n",
        "- Do **NOT** include other variables, which are not related to founders (e.g. success, company analytics score, company funded by VC etc.)\n",
        "- Drop onservations that have 0s everywhere (means they have not participated any test: in case of not dropping, they will be clustered together with founders that have the worst skills)\n",
        "- Read data in Python and run kMeans with k=odd_reasonable_number (e.g. 3,5,7...)\n",
        "- Save the clusters and add it (using VLOOKUP) to your general dataset\n",

        "### 2. Startup success analysis (10 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "While success depends on company's greatest assets - people, there are some other variables that may play not less significant role. Jack has suggested to conduct predictive analytics to understand quantitavely, what are the features that are important when analyzing startup success or failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Your task: build a classification model that is predicting startup success or failure. Find out most important features.***\n",
        "\n",
        "Note 1: founder clusters from Part 1 can be used in the classification model, instead of separate test results (but not mandatory).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note 2: while model can be developed on a smaller set of variables, the overall performance of the model will be better if more important variables are included. Thus, you are encouraged to implement feature engineering (i.e. change some text values into categorical or dummy variables). This will affect your prediction and, consequently, final exam results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solution steps in bullet points:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Read all the data, separate numericals and run Decision Tree to have at least one model developed\n",
        "- The model should include limitation on tree depth (not to overfit) and should fit the training set, yet the accuracy calculated for the test set (again, to avoid overfitting)\n",
        "- Get feature importances, save in a dataframe and sort them to learn about most important features (which for now will not be correct, as we neglected some important variables just because they were given as a string)\n",
        "- Improve the model by converting other variables to numeric format: binary variables are to be converted into categories (e.g. (\"No,\"Yes\") -> (0, 1)), yet if a variable gets more than 2 values it should be converted into categories after correct reordering, if logical order can be prescribed, and to dummies otherwise\n",

        "\n",
        "Arthur, the founder of Baker Street VC, is continously measuring the performance of his two investment analysts: Sherlock and Watson. Sherlock's strategy is to recommend investment in companies that have already received funding from at least 3 top VCs, while Watson's approach assumes careful observation of the startup founding team skills, skill balance and other variables.\n",
        "Arthur finds out, that Sherlock holds 100% success rate, while Watson has picked up correct startups for investment only in 76% of cases. As a result of worse performance, Arthur decides to fire Watson.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Please, state whether you agree with this decision or not and justify your response with at least 2 arguments (more is preferred).***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Some reasonable arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "- We have no information about **sample size**: the success rate for SHerlock can be calculated after investment in 1 or few companies, while Watson has already invested in 100s of companies.\n",
        "- We have no infromation on **returns** that those investments provide: maybe Sherlock invests in more mature and stable companies, which is safe but not attractive from the return prespective, while Watson invests in early stage companies, that are more risky, but at the same time provide extra return.\n",
        "- Imagine Sherlock's approach is typical: many VCs follow this approach, including top VCs that Sherlock is looking at. Therefore, Sherlock's information is actually representing **correlated signals**.\n",
        "- We do not know the **timeframe** of the investments: maybe both invested in a lot of startups, yet Sherlock was active recently, while Watson also invested years ago, when financial crisis happened, and the latter distorted his statistics.\n",
        "- Do we know how startup success is defined in this dataset? We do not. Maybe by default BakerStreet VC considers successful if a startup has received funding by 3 top VCs. This will mean that Sherlock has invested in startups that have already been considered successful (even vefore the investment decision) - i.e. **selection bias**.\n",
        "- Outcome is imperfectly related to performance as **luck** (in other words chance or randomness) may be involved. If Sherlock has better rate this period, that does not necessarely mean he will have similar next period. If he does have (i.e. results are persistent) then he is skilled, yet, if his results dramatically drop, then luck was involved here.\n",
        "- Yet, if Sherlocks results drop next period (but not dramatically) this should have been expected (**regression to the mean**).\n",
        "- [Romantic, but again related argument] Arthur (Conan Doyle) had clearly higher expectations from Sherlock, which drove up his motivation and resulted in better performance, which may not be the case with Watson.\n",

        "\n",
        "Cheat.AI is a startup company that is providing an Aritificial Intelligence backed up platform, that is able to detect cheating during exams on real-time basis. The platform has already been used by several top univerisities and the number of reported cheating cases has then significantely decreased. As thus, company experiences increase in demand, which drives revenues up. Baker Street VC, after observing the recent hike in revenues, decides to invest in Cheat.AI.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Negative Earnings Management** has been done before, which resulted in lower earnings in past periods and higher know, as a result - increased revenue (example to be provided).\n",
        "- **Positive Earnings Management** this period, which will necessarely result in lower returns sometimes soon (example to be provided).\n",
        "- **Correlation does not imply causality** - decrease in reported cheating might be the result of 3rd variable (e.g. student expectations after platform was bought, which is going to change, seasonality, student cohort difference, university policy, number of proctors, university reputation, Cheat.AI platform defects etc.)\n",
        "- **Selection bias** - top universities are not representative for all universities or for all client base of the platform.\n",
